### Background

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I work in the Section of Biostatistics within the Department of Public Health, where I first arrived as a postdoctoral researcher. My academic journey began at the Institut Curie in Paris, France, where I conducted a six-month research exchange for my Master’s thesis. I then pursued a PhD in survival analysis, focusing on clustered data such as meta-analyses and multicenter studies in the context of breast cancer.
My research primarily centers on applied and theoretical methodologies for longitudinal and time-to-event data, with a particular interest in causal inference and targeted learning in observational studies. Recently, I have also explored quantile estimation for time-to-event data in meta-analyses using pseudo-value approaches.
Many of my projects draw on data from Danish national health registries and randomized clinical trials. I collaborate closely with medical doctors and epidemiologists across a wide range of studies, and I provide statistical guidance to PhD and Master’s students in the Department of Infectious Diseases at Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark.

### Research Interests:

* Causal Inference from longitudinal observational data
* Methodology for complex intervenation settings
* Survival analysis and competing risks
* Clustered time-to-event data  
* Environmental epidemiology
* Randomized clinical trials
