    <p>This project, part of the <strong>SAFECHOICE</strong> initiative,  where we aim to understand the effects of hormonal contraception in women, specifically focusing on side effects. 
      As part of this project, we conducted a <strong>nationwide survey</strong> across Denmark, asking women about their experiences with contraception, 
      including the types they use and any side effects they have experienced.This survey data is integrated with <strong>registry data</strong>.</p>
    <p>From this large-scale study, we have initiates several research projects.</p>

 <p><strong>Capturing the effect of treatment breaks in users of hormonal contraception:</strong> <p>
<p>It is well-established that combined oral hormonal contraceptives, also known as ‘the pill’, increase the rate of thrombosis. 
It is very common for women to stop and restart combined oral hormonal contraceptives, however, little is known about the effect of treatment breaks on the risk of thrombosis.
Studies have shown a relatively higher rate of thrombosis in the first months of use and this observation has led doctors and guidelines to discourage women from frequently stopping and restarting treatment. 
The reasoning would be that re-starting use of combined oral hormonal contraceptives could increase the risk of thrombosis.  We employ targeted learning methods for longitudinal data to define 
the effect of a treatment break in a target trial framework for causal inference. Specifically, we compare the two interventions: (1) sustained use versus (2) taking a break within two years,
and we employ stochastic interventions to identify the effect of a treatment break without focusing on its specific duration and/or timing.<p>
