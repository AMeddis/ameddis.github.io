    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Causal Inference on Side Effects of Hormonal Contraception</h3>
    <p>This project, part of the <strong>SAFECHOICE</strong> initiative,  where we aim to understand the effects of hormonal contraception in women, specifically focusing on side effects. 
      As part of this project, we conducted a <strong>nationwide survey</strong> across Denmark, asking women about their experiences with contraception, 
      including the types they use and any side effects they have experienced.This survey data is integrated with <strong>registry data</strong>.</p>
    <p>From this large-scale study, we have initiates several research projects.</p>
 <p><strong>Capturing the effect of treatment breaks in users of hormonal contraception:</strong> </p>
<p>It is well-established that combined oral hormonal contraceptives, also known as â€˜the pillâ€™, increase the rate of thrombosis. 
It is very common for women to stop and restart combined oral hormonal contraceptives, however, little is known about the effect of treatment breaks on the risk of thrombosis.
Studies have shown a relatively higher rate of thrombosis in the first months of use and this observation has led doctors and guidelines to discourage women from frequently stopping and restarting treatment. 
The reasoning would be that re-starting use of combined oral hormonal contraceptives could increase the risk of thrombosis.  We employ targeted learning methods for longitudinal data to define 
the effect of a treatment break in a target trial framework for causal inference. Specifically, we compare the two interventions: (1) sustained use versus (2) taking a break within two years,
and we employ stochastic interventions to identify the effect of a treatment break without focusing on its specific duration and/or timing.</p>
 <p> <strong> Statistical challenges:</strong>  Treatment heterogeneity, definition of stochastic intervention, identification problem of the target parameter </p>

  <p> <strong> Hormonal contraception and anxiety:</strong> </p>
<p>Evidence suggests link between mental health disorders including depression and anxiety and transitions in female hormones. The use of hormonal contraception has previously been asscoated to 
  an increased risk of depression especially among young users. Because of similar patterns in disease occurrence and overlapping symptoms, 
  it is not unlikely that hormonal contraception use could also be linked to the development of anxiety disorders. 
  We are interested in the risk of developing anxiety disorders in current and previous users by analyzing self-reported anxiety from a danish survey. 
  In order to improve generalizability on the target population, we employ the danish register-data to obtain calibration weights.</p>
   <p> <strong> Statistical challenges:</strong>  Generalizability of results from survey data using observational studies, when exposure and outcome are not independent on the selection mechanism.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 0;"> Pseudo-values approach for quantile estimation in Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis </h3>
 <p> Individual Patient Data (IPD) meta-analysis synthesizes evidence based on multiple clinical trials.
   For survival endpoints, several approaches have been previously proposed, that mostly involves hazard ratios and proportional hazard models.
   Quantiles are more flexible and robust quantitative tools for characterizing event times than mean-based regression models, and the proportional hazard assumption is not needed and it allows us to detect potential late treatment effects.
   Moreover, despite many methods have been introduced for correlated survival data, they all consider asymptotic results for infinite number of groups, which is not true for a meta-analysis where few clinical trials are pooled together.
   Here we employ pseudo-values approach to account for the correlation across trials and we define exact test and confidence interval. </p>
      <p><strong> Statistical challenges:</strong> Pooled quantile estimation for meta-analysis, asymptotic distribution of the quantiles difference. </p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 0;"> Environmental epidemiological research on delayed effects of exposures to environmental contaminants </h3>
<p> The emphasis is on prospective studies of birth cohorts exposed to contaminants, especially in the Faroe Islands (Denmark). 
   Research has mainly been focused on exposure to perfluorinated substances, PCBs and fluoride and their effect on negative effects on growth and development in general, such as IQ score, metabolic response, semen abnormalities and  infertility.
